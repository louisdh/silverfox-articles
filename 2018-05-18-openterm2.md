[OpenTerm 2.0](https://itunes.apple.com/app/terminal/id1323205755?mt=8&at=1010lII4) is out now with scripting, tabs, networking commands and much more! This is now a fully featured, [open source](https://github.com/louisdh/openterm), terminal for iPhone & iPad. Available on the App Store for free.

This also marks the first published app using [Cub](https://github.com/louisdh/cub) and [SavannaKit](https://github.com/louisdh/savannakit).

Thank you to all the beta testers and contributors of OpenTerm!

Full release notes:

* Scripting – uses a new programming language, called Cub, that is inspired by Swift and specifically created for OpenTerm
    * A guide for Cub is included for learning the language
    * A documentation panel lists all available functions you can use in your scripts
    * Scripts essentially become commands that you can execute from anywhere
    * Scripts can ask for user input (e.g. “Enter a number: “)
    * Scripts can execute any command, even other scripts
    * [Cub is open source](https://github.com/louisdh/cub)
* Tabs support
    * Also supports split view (like Safari)
    * Uses [TabView](https://github.com/IMcD23/TabView) by [Ian McDowell](https://twitter.com/ian_mcdowell)
* New built in commands, including some essential networking commands:
    * credits, cub, dig, host, nc, nslookup, pbcopy, pbpaste, ping, rlogin, say, sleep, ssh-keygen, telnet, unlink
* Directory bookmarks – save directories and easily revisit them

* Small things:
	* A refreshed design
	* UTF8 support in input and output (pro tip: you can use emoticons as a script name!)
	* Auto completion for running commands
	* Allow commands to be cancelled
	* Show hidden directories in auto complete
	* Tab to complete command keyboard shortcut
	* Auto complete for paths
