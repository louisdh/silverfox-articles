Today I'm releasing two new projects:

## The Cub Programming Language
Cub is an interpreted scripting language inspired by Swift. It was designed specifically for scripting in OpenTerm. Cub was forked from [Lioness](https://github.com/louisdh/lioness), my (first) programming language [I released past spring](https://silverfox.be/articles/2017-06-01-intro-lioness.html). As you might expect by now, [Cub is open source](https://github.com/louisdh/cub)!

## SavannaKit
SavannaKit is a protocol oriented framework for creating IDEs for iOS and macOS, written in Swift. It contains a `SyntaxTextView`, which is a cross-platform Text View with syntax highlighting and line numbers. [SavannaKit is also open source](https://github.com/louisdh/savannakit)!

[I first teased SavannaKit back in June](https://twitter.com/LouisDhauwe/status/878639483511595008). It feels so good to finally release it.
