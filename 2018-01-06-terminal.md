Today I’m releasing Terminal, a sandboxed command line interface, for iOS. The app is free, with no in-app purchases or ads. It’s [available on the iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/terminal/id1323205755?mt=8&at=1010lII4) for iPhone and iPad.

This project would not have been possible without open source software. Therefore it’s only logical to make the app open source as well. It’s [on GitHub](https://github.com/louisdh/terminal) and contributions are welcome. 

As a nice bonus I have implemented [PanelKit](https://github.com/louisdh/panelkit) for the commands history.
