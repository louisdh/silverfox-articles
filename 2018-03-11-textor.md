Today I'm releasing [Textor](https://itunes.apple.com/app/textor/id1330406995?mt=8&at=1010lII4), a plain text editor for iOS. I started this project while creating [OpenTerm](https://silverfox.be/articles/2018-01-20-openterm.html). I was surprised to learn that iOS doesn't have an app to open .txt files out of the box. Even Pages doesn't allow you to open and save .txt files. 

Textor is fully optimized for iOS 11 with the system documents browser. It's a very simple, yet essential, app, which is why it's free.

Technically, Textor is a couple of system APIs glued together:

```swift
Textor = UIDocument + UIDocumentBrowserViewController + UITextView
```

Textor is [available on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/textor/id1330406995?mt=8&at=1010lII4).
