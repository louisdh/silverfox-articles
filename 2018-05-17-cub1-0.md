[Cub](https://github.com/louisdh/cub) 1.0 is now officially out! 

I have published a guide [online](https://silverfox.be/cub/guide/index.html) (which is also included in OpenTerm 2.0). This guide is written in Markdown, and [is open source](https://github.com/louisdh/cub-guide). 

Now that Cub has become relatively mature, I'm thinking of replacing the [Lioness](https://github.com/louisdh/Lioness) project with a special language mode of Cub. That way there will be two programming languages (a scripting and a shader language) with a 90% shared code base. This will hopefully allow me to add the [long overdue shader feature](https://twitter.com/LouisDhauwe/status/870040579006230530) to Pixure soon.
