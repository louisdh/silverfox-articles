With the release of [Pixure 2.2](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/03/20/pixure-panelkit) I introduced PanelKit, a UI framework that enables floating panels on iPad.
The reception was [amazing](https://twitter.com/LouisDhauwe/status/833797464801103872), even leading to some great chats at WWDC with Apple engineers. 

Today, Iâ€™m thrilled to announce PanelKit 2.0, which builds on the initial concept. The full release notes are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/louisdh/panelkit/releases/tag/2.0.0), including guides for the new opt-in features (such as panel resizing).

The panel resizing took lots of experimenting, which I will talk about in a future blog post.
