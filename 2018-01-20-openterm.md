10 days, that's how long it took for Apple to remove [my command line app named Terminal](https://silverfox.be/articles/2018-01-06-terminal.html) from the App Store. 

*Apple's message (Jan 16, 2018 at 12:10 AM CET):*

> We are writing to let you know about new information regarding your app, Terminal, version 1.1, currently live on the App Store.
>
> Upon re-evaluation, we found that your app is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines. Specifically, we found:
>
> Legal - 5.2.5
> Your app is too similar to Terminal, which creates a misleading association with Apple products.
>
> To resolve this issue, please review your app design and app metadata and revise it to differentiate it from existing Apple products. 
>
> For this reason, your app will be removed from sale on the App Store at this time.

I totally understand Apple's issue here, regardless of wether they will ever make a first party Terminal for iOS. My Terminal app was simply too similar to the Mac app with the same name by Apple.

The new name is OpenTerm, which puts a nice focus on the fact that [the app is open source](https://github.com/louisdh/terminal). Furthermore, the icon has been updated to prevent any further confusion. It's [available as an update in the App Store now](https://itunes.apple.com/app/terminal/id1323205755?mt=8&at=1010lII4). The app is still free, with no in-app purchases or ads.
