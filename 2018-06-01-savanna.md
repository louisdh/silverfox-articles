Today I'm releasing Savanna, an IDE for the Cub programming language. Savanna is available for both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/savanna/id1350247486?mt=8&at=1010lII4) and [macOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/savanna/id1350247507?mt=12&at=1010lII4). The macOS version is very basic at the moment, but if the rumors about "iOS apps on macOS" work out that will change! 

[Savanna is open source](https://github.com/louisdh/savanna) and uses [SavannaKit](https://github.com/louisdh/savannakit) for its code editor.

The iOS version of Savanna contains a preview of [PanelKit](https://github.com/louisdh/panelkit) 3.0, which supports top/bottom pinning and brings some small improvements to the panel dragging behavior. PanelKit 3.0 is expected to be finished this summer, after which it will roll out to [Pixure](https://itunes.apple.com/app/pixure/id893400841?mt=8&at=1010lII4) and [OpenTerm](https://itunes.apple.com/app/terminal/id1323205755?mt=8&at=1010lII4).
