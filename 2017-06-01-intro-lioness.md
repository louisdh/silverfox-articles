For over the past 9 months, I've been working on perhaps my biggest project yet: a programming language.
Not just a specification for a language, I have developed a lexer, parser, compiler & interpreter.
All of this is without any dependencies, and 100% in Swift. 

It's called [Lioness](https://github.com/louisdh/lioness), and it's open source. If you're interested, the GitHub [readme](https://github.com/louisdh/lioness) contains lots of details. There's also a [document with an opcode table](https://github.com/louisdh/lioness/blob/master/docs/Scorpion.md) for the bytecode (called Scorpion).

This is by no means a v1.0, there's [a lot that still needs to be done](https://github.com/louisdh/lioness#roadmap). Pull requests are welcome!
